# avengers-api
A simple fullstack application that allows a user to enter a name from the original avengers, what returns is the title of all the standalone movies and/or shows that character was in and their release year.


## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, JavaScript, Node, Express

I started out with my server side javascript to hardcode my character options. Then made sure that the information was retrievable when a user pressed a button on an html page containing the tag to the server side script. Express and node were used to test each step to make sure the proper progress was being made and eliminate potential bugs. Once completed, Git was used to push all documentation to Github. 
## Optimizations

This project has hardcoded information, in the future I wish to change this to allow the user to access/add more information into a database. 

## Lessons Learned:

This is my second fullstack application, a lot of learning to understand the process and syntax happened during this project.
